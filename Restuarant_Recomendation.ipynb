upto the mark the butter chicken did not taste like butter chicken the chicken dumplings were tasteless the chicken nuggets were too oily the cheese cigars had a weird taste and the crispy lamb was not crispy at all the gulab jamun cheesecake did not have the texture of a cheesecake the blueberry pie was slightly hard and the chocolate truffle cake could have been much better the ambience is posh and well maintained the food presentation is pretty good but with the long waiting time we had to wait for 45 minutes to get out food and subpar food quality i wouldnt recommend this place to
